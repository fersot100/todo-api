Tokens are long generated strings that authenticate users to access certain methods on a website.

	JWT - JSON Web Token

A CLAIM is secure information that a token can relay to the user. The web token will contain all the information the user needs with little security necessities within itself. 

A token is a JSON object on its own

	aaaaaaaa.bbbbbbbb.cccccccc

A token has three sections separated by a dot, all of it is base 64 encoded

1) The header (aaa) will have 
	- the 'typ' attribute which for our JSON web tokens should be 'JWT
	- the 'alg' attribute specifying the hashing algorithm used (HS256, RS512, ES384, etc.)

2) The payload/claims (bbb) has 
	-Any information we need to transmite in JSON format
	-The information related to the token itself
	-Any information that needs to be secure should be encrypted by the server

3) The signature/secret (ccc)
	A JWS class has the .sign() function that signs off a token 


The server must verify the token every time the user requests information that requires authentication
